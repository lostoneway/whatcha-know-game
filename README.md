# whatcha-know-game

__Reversed spot for working link when we're live! And screenshot of completed app.__

I have always enjoyed a little quiz game. You know, just to pass the time while waiting in line at the grocery store or sitting in a waiting room. So I decided to try to build my own using the new tools I've learned thus far: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Problems I run into go here

## What are some goals for this web app?
- Gain a better understanding of JavaScript, particularly API usage and manipulating the DOM
- Have clean code, sematic HTML and dry (as I can get it!) CSS. 
- Make the game feel inviting and folks want to return to play again. 

## Ways to tackle the project
Now that I know what I want to build, here are ideas to achieve my goals : 
* Use [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
* Use a cooler color palette, so no fire engine red this time around
* Mobile Friendly is must, since I'll play primarly on my phone
* Google Fonts: Poppins 
* Rounded borders, light transitions between questions/selecting answers
